### Workflows

This directory contains the files needed to create the SUEP ntuples from NanoAOD files. There are 3 main analyses contained here:

Channel               | Files
--------------------- | -------------
ggF offline/scouting  | SUEP_Coffea, SUEP_utils
Graph Neural Net      | ML_Coffea, ML_utils
Associated Production | ZH_Coffea, ZH_utils

## CMS Corrections

Additional corrections for CMS analyses are stored in the CMS_corrections directory and can be called directly in the main worfklows. Some, but not all of these corrections are common between channels.

See table below:

Correction            | Channels          | Status
--------------------- | ----------------- | -----------------------------------------------
Golden JSON           | ggF, ML and ZH    | - [x]
JECs                  | ggF, ML and ZH    | - [x]
Parton Shower         | ggF, ML and ZH    | - [x]
Track killing         | ggF, ML and ZH    | - [x] (Percentages for scouting need updating)
Higgs pT reweight     | ggF, ML and ZH    | - [ ]
Prefire               | ggF, ML and ZH    | - [x] Need CMSSW_10_6_26 (A02)
Lepton SF             | ZH                | - [ ]


Other uncertainties are added on the fly while making histograms in the plotting directory:

Correction            | Channels          | Status
--------------------- | ----------------- | -----------------------------------------------
Pileup Weight         | ggF, ML and ZH    | - [x]
Trigger SF            | ggF, ML and ZH    | - [ ] IN PROGRESS
GNN Uncertainty       | ML                | - [x]
  
## Additional utils

Additional tools are used for various features:

1) root_rewrite: Fix naming issues with Scouting NTuples
2) pandas_utils: Tools to save pandas dataframes to hdf5 files
3) merger      : Tool to merge output files together
